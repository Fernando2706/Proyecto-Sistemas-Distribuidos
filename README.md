## Distributed Systems final project => Note: 10

You must implement an image filter service for a social network 
• The purpose of the system is to avoid overloading the client terminal to extend the useful life of the batteries and reduce consumption 
• During the capture of requirements, discrepancies have arisen regarding the architecture to be designed and therefore, it will be necessary to implement two different systems:

• SYSTEM B: It will use each part of the system in a dedicated way, that is, each node it will contain the code of the filter to implement and it will always execute the same filters
• Both systems A and B will assign the processing nodes based on CPU load and latency. 
• At the end of both implementations, a report must be provided justifying the advantages and disadvantages of each system, providing results of the actual implementation
